The connected parts of a graph are called its components.


A tree is a connected graph that consists of n nodes and nยก1 edges. There is
a unique path between any two nodes of a tree.

Two nodes are neighbors or adjacent if there is an edge between them. The
degree of a node is the number of its neighbors.



The sum of degrees in a graph is always 2m, where m is the number of edges,
because each edge increases the degree of exactly two nodes by one.

A graph is regular if the degree of every node is a constant d. A graph is
complete if the degree of every node is n-1, i.e., the graph contains all possible
edges between the nodes.

A graph is bipartite if it is possible to color it using two colors. It turns out
that a graph is bipartite exactly when it does not contain a cycle with an odd
number of edges.

A graph is simple if no edge starts and ends at the same node, and there are no
multiple edges between two nodes.

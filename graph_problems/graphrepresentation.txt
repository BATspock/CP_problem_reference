Adjacency list representation
In the adjacency list representation, each node x in the graph is assigned an
adjacency list that consists of nodes to which there is an edge from x. Adjacency
lists are the most popular way to represent graphs, and most algorithms can be
efficiently implemented using them.

Adjacency matrix representation
An adjacency matrix is a two-dimensional array that indicates which edges
the graph contains. We can efficiently check from an adjacency matrix if there is
an edge between two nodes. The matrix can be stored as an array

Edge list representation
An edge list contains all edges of a graph in some order. This is a convenient
way to represent a graph if the algorithm processes all edges of the graph and it
is not needed to find edges that start at a given node.
